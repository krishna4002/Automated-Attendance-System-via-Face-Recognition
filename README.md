# üß† AI-Powered Attendance System using Face Recognition

A real-time AI-powered attendance system that uses face recognition through a webcam to **automate attendance** for both **students (per class period)** and **teachers (once per day)**. The system includes **voice confirmation** (Windows only), **CSV logging**, and **schedule customization** ‚Äî all in a simple Streamlit web app.

This project demonstrates a practical use of machine learning, computer vision, and user interface design to solve a real-world problem in education and corporate environments.

## About This Project

This system is designed to eliminate the manual and error-prone process of recording attendance. It works by recognizing the user's face from a live webcam feed and automatically logging their name, time, and subject in a structured CSV file.

- **Students**: Attendance is recorded for each subject period.
- **Teachers**: Attendance is recorded only once per day.
- The system prevents **duplicate entries**, supports **schedule upload via CSV**, and offers **voice-based confirmation** after successful recognition.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishna4002/AI-Powered-Attendance-System.git
cd AI-Powered-Attendance-System
```

### 2. (Optional) Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üì∏ Collecting Face Data via UI

Instead of manually placing images in `dataset/`, you can run the face capture UI:

```bash
streamlit run face_captured_app.py
```

This interface allows you to:
- Capture images directly from the webcam
- Save them under a named folder inside `dataset/`
- Automatically collect ~30 images per person for training

After capturing faces, update the embeddings by running:

```bash
python generate_embeddings.py
```

---

## Add Students or Teachers (Manual Method)

1. Inside the `dataset/` folder, create a folder with the person‚Äôs **full name**  
   Example: `dataset/Krishnagopal Jay/`

2. Add **30+ clear face images** of that person (1 face per image)

3. Run:

```bash
python generate_embeddings.py
```

This script generates `embeddings.npy` for face matching.

---

## Run the Attendance App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

From the web interface, choose:
- `Student` ‚Üí Period-wise attendance
- `Teacher` ‚Üí Daily attendance (once)

---

## Schedule Setup

### Option 1: Manual Entry
Add subjects and timings directly inside the app.

### Option 2: Upload CSV Schedule

Example `schedule.csv`:

```csv
Subject,Start,End
Math,09:00,09:45
Physics,10:00,10:45
Break,10:45,11:00
```

Upload via the Streamlit interface when prompted.

---

## Voice Confirmation (Windows Only)

When attendance is successfully marked, the system speaks:

> ‚ÄúAttendance marked for Krishnagopal Jay‚Äù

Make sure:
- Your device has working speakers
- `pyttsx3` is installed (already included)
- You are running the system on Windows OS

---

## Attendance Logs

All logs are stored in the `attendance_logs/` folder:

```
attendance_logs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ student_attendance_YYYY-MM-DD.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ teacher_attendance_YYYY-MM-DD.csv
```

Each row contains: **Name, Role, Time, Subject (if applicable)**.

---

## Behavior & Constraints

- One face per image (no group photos)
- Only one attendance per person per period/day
- Student attendance allowed **only during scheduled time slots**
- Embeddings must be updated when adding new users
- Recognition accuracy improves with clear, consistent images

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Voice not working | Ensure you're on Windows and speakers are on |
| Face not recognized | Add better images (front-facing, well-lit) |
| Can't write CSV | Close the CSV file in Excel and try again |
| App not launching | Run `streamlit run app.py` in an active environment |

---
